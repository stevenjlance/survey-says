import { people } from "./data.js";

// 1. All the survey responses are stored in a list called "people" in the data.js file. It has been imported here. Console.log people to see the list.


// 2. console.log out the name of the first person who responded to the survey


// 3. Print out Brenton's second favorite band


// 4. For each person on this list, print out a descriptor of where they live in the form "____ lives in _____."





// 5. Print out each person's nickname. Write some control flow that determines whether / how to respond if someone didn't provide a nickname.






// 6. Find the average of the respondents' ages.





// 7. Print out the percentage of respondents who have brown hair.





// 8. Create two new lists - one for programmers, and one for non programmers.
//    Sort all the people in the main list into these two more specific lists.





// 9. CHALLENGE: Iterate over the list in order to figure out how many respondents listed "The Office" as one of their favorite shows.




// 10. DOUBLE CHALLENGE: Print out a list of all the bands that are liked by at least two people.
//    Pro-tip: some respondents capitalized band names and other respondents did not, so for example, if Panic at the Disco isn't listed, your code isn't accurately reporting your results.





// 11. TRILPE SUPER BONUS CHALLENGE: Identify anyone on the list who has no common interests (bands or shows) with anyone else. Print their names.
